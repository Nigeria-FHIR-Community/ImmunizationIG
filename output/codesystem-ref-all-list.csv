It includes both active and inactive vaccines available in the US. CVX codes for inactive vaccines allow transmission of historical immunization records. When a MVX (manufacturer) code is paired with a CVX (vaccine administered) code, the specific trade named vaccine may be indicated. These codes should be used for immunization messages using either HL7 Version 2.3.1 or HL7 Version 2.5.1. CVX is the underlying Master Code System for V2 table 0292 (Vaccines Administered). The machine readable name for CVX in PHIN VADS is PH_VaccinesAdministeredCVX_CDC_NIP. The version of the CVX code set for certification can be found on the archive page:[https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/mu3versioned_codes.asp](https://www2a.cdc.gov/vaccines/iis/iisstandards/mu3versioned_codes.asp)     The Status column indicates if the vaccine is currently available in the United States.    *  Active: A currently available administrable vaccine     *  Inactive: An administrable vaccine formulation that is no longer available for patient administration, but can be found in historical patient records OR A historical record of a vaccine administered where the exact formulation is unknown     *  Pending: A vaccine that is expected to become active in the future     *  Non-US: A vaccine that available outside the US only     *  Never Active: A vaccine that was never available and is not in the pipeline of new vaccines     The Last Updated column indicates the last time this particular vaccine code was updated in this table.
