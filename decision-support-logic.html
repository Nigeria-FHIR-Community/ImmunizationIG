<p>The decision-support logic component of the adaptation kit provides the decision-support logic and algorithms, as well as the scheduling of services, in accordance with WHO guidelines. In this DAK, the decision logic and algorithms deconstruct the recommendations within the immunization guidelines and guidance into a format that clearly labels the inputs and outputs that would be operationalized in a digital decision-support system.</p>

<h3 id="decision-support-logic-overview">Decision Support Logic Overview</h3>

<p>The table below provides an overview of the decision-support tables and algorithms for the different business processes in an Immunization system. The structure of the decision-support tables is based on an adaptation of the Decision Model and Notation (DMN), an industry standard for modeling and executing decision logic. These decision-support tables detail the business rules, data inputs, and outputs to support IIS business processes.</p>
