  A persona is a depiction of a relevant stakeholder, or end-user, of the system. In this section, the goal is to provide a clear depiction of the end-users, supervisors, and related stakeholders who would be interacting with the digital system or involved in the care pathway. 
  The personas were derived from the Basic Guide on Routine Immunization for Service Providers in Nigeria</a> 
  and the  <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/380303/9789240099456-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">Digital Adaptation Kit for Immunization</a>. 
  It was further refined to reflect Nigeria by identifying the real user personas during the requirement gathering workshop.
